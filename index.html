        The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/research/design-and-ai">TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering</a> (IDE) faculty is hosting the premier European event on Design for AI, October 14, 2022. This one-day symposium features keynote speakers, workshops and networking opportunities that will provide insight for those involved in the design and deployment of AI systems and partnerships.
        <br><br>
        In a world full of artificial intelligence, how do we design spaces and opportunities for human growth and wellbeing? How to build safe and meaningful relationships between AI and people? We happily invite you to this conversation at IDE's first Design for AI &mdash; Are we designing the AI we need? symposium on Friday 14th of October. In collaboration with the TU Delft AI Initiative and Mondai &mdash; House of AI, we welcome internationally renowned speakers Elizabeth Churchill, John Zimmermann, Matt Jones and Caroline Sinders. During the day we also provide workshops, such as from the CHI NL Community. Tickets are available via: https://design4aisympo.eventbrite.nl/. Don’t miss out on the Early Bird tickets! Limited spots, first come, first serve.

          <h3>John Zimmerman</h3>
          <h4>Tang Family Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction<b>CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute School of Design</b></h4>
          <p class="bio"><i>Why AI initiatives have an 85% failure rate</i><br>A lack of ideation, a failure to search for opportunities where mediocre performing AI still adds value, and failure to assess and select project ideas based on AI performance risks, FATE risks, and value to customers and service providers. I believe there is a huge opportunity for design to scaffold ideation and project selection; to facilitate communication between data scientists, software developers, PMs, and domain experts; and to create boundary objects that allow better communication and understanding in the earliest stages of an AI innovation process.</p>
          <img class="gray" src="assets/John_Zimmerman5.jpg" alt="John Zimmerman" width="400">
          <p class="bio">John Zimmerman researches human-AI interaction, human-robot interaction, and innovation with analytics and AI. For more than twenty years, he has designed novel, intelligent systems ranging from one of the first TV show recommenders to a crowdsourced, transit arrival system to a decision support tool for implanting mechanical hearts to a system that keeps parents from forgetting to pick up their children. He’s published more than 150 papers, is a member of the ACM CHI Academy, and while working for Philips, he invented the way everyone scrolls on their smartphone. He teaches courses in service design, lean startup, and on the design of AI products and services.
<br><br>John is the co-author of the book: <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/design-research-through-practice/koskinen/978-0-12-385502-2?country=NL&format=print&utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=netherlandsshopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwof6WBhD4ARIsAOi65ajm7yAk05zygSve_7R49CKXscm5mXvLCdz7P6HkxRgKzXUubVdagEIaAo7IEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Design Research through Practice</a>.

<h3>Matt Jones</h3>
<h4>Principal Designer at <a href="https://www.moixa.com">Moixa</a></h4>
<p class="bio"><i>Optometrists, Octopii, Rubber Ducks & Centaurs</i><br>
Designing for (and with) systems featuring AI has many emerging metaphors - but how do they match to the materiality of the systems they represent? Do they aid legibility or widen the mystery gap? Looking back at projects I've worked on, I'll examine how they've informed my practice of design in the field - and how they land in the world</p>

<img class="gray" src="assets/matt-jones.jpg" alt="Matt Jones" width="400">
<p class="bio">Matt Jones is Principal Designer at <a href="https://www.lunarenergy.com">Lunar Energy</a>, a smart battery company enabling decarbonisation. He has been designing digital products and services since 1995 at organizations such as BBC and Nokia. From 2009-2013 he was a principal at BERG, a design and invention company in London that had projects exhibited in MoMA, and products featured in the FT, FastCompany, Wired and Marvel comics. In 2013 he moved to New York City to join Google Creative Lab where projects he worked on included Google Expeditions and <a href="http://google.com/sunroof">Sunroof</a>. In 2016 he returned to London as part of Google’s Research division, where he worked on AI concepts for hardware and services until 2021. He originally studied Architecture, has written on interaction design (amongst other things) for 20 years at <a href="http://www.petafloptimism.com">petafloptimism.com</a> and has taught design at the RCA, Goldsmiths, SVA, Umea and CIID.
