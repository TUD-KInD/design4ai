    <p>
<!--         This website is a template that you could use for a (small) academic conference. 
        It&rsquo;s got a page for registration, where you can embed a Google Form or some other way for participants to register.
        It&rsquo;s got a program page to list the schedule for the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a directions page to add a bunch of instructions how to get to the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a page to put up the flyers and other promotional materials for folks to download. -->
        The TU Delft Industrial Design Engineering (IDE) faculty is hosting the premier
        European event on Design for AI,
        October 14, 2022. This one-day symposium features keynote speakers, workshops
        and networking opportunities
        that will provide insight for those involved in the design and deployment of AI systems and partnerships.

        The event will be attended by a range of international attendees including students, designers
        and engineers from the IDE faculty,
        and other TU Delft researchers involved in AI including those from TU Delft’s many
        AI labs. Dutch and international design agencies and industry will also participate.

        This paragraph is just some filler text to give the homepage some volume:

        The symposium will foreground the importance of design in the
        creation of AI applications and research. We’ll
        stimulate discussion about AI design methods, strategies, and ethics.
