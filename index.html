          <p class="bio">John Zimmerman is an interaction designer and researcher. He teaches courses on interaction design, service innovation, design theory, and HCI methods. John's research falls into four areas. 1) Interaction with intelligent systems: He investigates how to blend human and machine intelligence. He's also interested in how designers can more easily grasp machine learning as a design material. His current work includes a decision support system that aids clinicians in deciding if they should implant an artificial heart. 2) Designing for the Self 3) Public service innovation via social computing and 4) Research through design: He studies how design inquiry, with its focus on exploring possible futures through a process of making things, can be integrated with scientific and engineering inquiry. Before joining the HCI Institute, John researched personalized TV systems for Philips Research.<br><br>John is the co-author of the book: <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/design-research-through-practice/koskinen/978-0-12-385502-2?country=NL&format=print&utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=netherlandsshopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwof6WBhD4ARIsAOi65ajm7yAk05zygSve_7R49CKXscm5mXvLCdz7P6HkxRgKzXUubVdagEIaAo7IEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Design Research through Practice</a>.

<h3>Matt Jones</h3>
<h4>Principal Designer at <a href="https://www.moixa.com">Moixa</a></h4>
<p class="bio"><i>Optometrists, Octopii, Rubber Ducks & Centaurs</i><br>
Designing for (and with) systems featuring AI has many emerging metaphors - but how do they match to the materiality of the systems they represent? Do they aid legibility or widen the mystery gap? Looking back at projects I've worked on, I'll examine how they've informed my practice of design in the field - and how they land in the world</p>
